## ðŸ“Š About This Figure

This interactive plot allows users to explore how different carbonate chemistry parameters influence the growth response of various diatom species.

### Instructions:
- Use the **Species** dropdown to select a specific species or view "All species".
- Select parameters for the **X**, **Y**, and **Z** axes to explore relationships in **2D** or **3D**.
  - To switch to 2D, set the **Z-Axis** to `"None"`.
- Hover over points to view experimental metadata and values.
- Zoom, rotate, and reset the plot using your browser or mouse controls.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- **Carbonate chemistry values** are shown as the mean of initial and final measurements Â± standard deviation.
- **DSi error bars** represent standard error of duplicate measurements.
- Cultures in **grey** did not show net positive growth and/or did not reach target biomass during the experiment and were excluded from analysis/fitting.
